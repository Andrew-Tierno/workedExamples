## Please add new worked examples!
This is a collaborative project to add worked examples to Code in Place. Thanks for your addition. Ideally problems are
- clear
- relevant to what students are learning
- real world (if possible)
- fun (if possible)
- short 

## In order to create a new worked example 
1. Make a new dir in 'examples' for your new worked example
2. Add the following files to your worked example
+ title.txt (the title of your worked example)
+ soln.py (the solution)
+ credit.txt (who wrote this!)
+ index.html (the body of the problem, written as HTML).

We are going to compile your worked example to make sure it gets styled correctly. In the index.html don't include a title, 
solution or credit. We will put that in.

## In order to compile a new worked example 
1. Simply run compile.py from the root of the project.
2. Your compiled worked example will be in the /en/ directory
3. Warning: do not edit the file in en! Each time we compile it gets overwritten. Any changes should go into the examples dir.

## In order to submit your worked example
Make a pull request!
https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
If you have trouble, just send the worked example directory (the one in examples, not in en)
