<p>Prime numbers have many applications in mathematics, cryptography, etc. You will write a program to test a user-provided integer for primality.</p>

<p>The program requirements are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The program should support testing numbers up to 10,000,000.</li>
    <li>The program should ask the user for a number to test and output whether or not the number is prime.</li>
    <li>The program should display the 10 primes &lt;= the number provided. If there are fewer than 10, then it should display all that fit the criteria.</li>
    <li>The program should be fast.</li>
    <li>Extra credit: support numbers up to 100,000,000 (or more!).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are many ways to calculate primes, but for small numbers the Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most effective algorithms. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Wikipedia article</a> has a good description. The provided solution uses that algorithm.</p>

This program will test whether a specified integer is prime.
It will also print out the 10 primes &lt;= the provided value.
For the sake of time, only numbers up to 10000000 are allowed.
