	Simple Slot Machine
</p>
<p>In order to build a simple slot machine, we'll make the following simplifications:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>The machine must output 3 digits, where the digit `d` is 1 <= d < 10. </strong>
	</li>
	<li>
    <strong>The two winning conditions are if any two digits are matching, the user wins 10 tokens. If all three are a match the user wins the jackpot: 100 tokens. </strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>The user should start out with 10 tokens. Once all tokens are spent, the game should end.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>To create additional suspense, the digits should be printed out one-by-one with 0.5 seconds between reveals.</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p> Write a program that continually reads commands from the user and executes the given command. Show your work in the following way:</p>
