<p>Your task is to write a simple number guessing game. The program's specifications are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The program should ask the user for their name and refer to the user by name for the duration of the session.</li>
    <li>The user should be prompted for a guess in a predefined interval that is provided to the user.</li>
    <li>The user should be continuously prompted for guesses until they guess the correct answer.</li>
    <li>The user should be provided with feedback about the guess (whether it's too high or low).</li>
    <li>The user should also be notified if the guess is outside the allowable range.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Once the correct number is guessed, a new game should be started.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following game: </p>
