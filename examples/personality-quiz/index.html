	Since quarantine began, my Facebook has been taken over by various logical and astrological (just teasing!) quizzes. However, none of the quizzes were about a very important topic... me. That's why I came up with my very own personality quiz! You should have all the tools you need to build your own. We'll even include a correct-answer-counter to make the quiz more competitive--then you'll know who really knows you best.
</p>

<p> 
	Write a program that asks the user multiple choice questions about you (or anything, really). The quiz should include at least 3 questions that have at least 3 choices each.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user should be instructed how to enter their answer.</li>
	<li>After each question, the user should be told if they got the question right or wrong.</li>
	<li>At the end of the quiz, the user should be told their score (the number of correct answers).</li>
	<li>Each run of the program only needs to play the quiz once.</li>
	<li>You can assume the user will only enter valid guesses for each question.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p> 
	For clarity, I suggest keeping your Question/Answer format as multiple choice. However, there's nothing stopping you from including True/False or Fill-In-The-Blank questions! We'll count that as extra credit.</p>
<p>
	I hope you have fun making this and sharing this with your friends and family!
