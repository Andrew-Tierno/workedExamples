    There are three gods A, B, and C. Their names are, in no particular order, <i>True</i>, <i>False</i>, and <i>Random</i>. As the names suggest, <i>True</i> always tells the truth; <i>False</i> always lies; <i>Random</i> lies sometimes and behaves randomly. You can ask three yes/no questions and in the end, you need to tell the names of A, B, and C. One challenging part is that these gods speak another language, so they can only answer <i>da</i> or <i>ya</i>. Unfortunately, you have no idea whether <i>da</i> means yes or no.

    This is dubbed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever"><b>The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever</b></a> by American philosopher and logician George Boolos. Your job is to write a simple console program that allows your friend to play this puzzle, as shown in the sample programs below (blue words are user input).

    In each run of the program, the names of A, B, C should be randomly assigned to one of "True", "False", and "Random" and the meaning of <i>da</i>/<i>ya</i> takes a random choice of yes/no.

    You can assume that all user inputs are valid. Be careful when you are dealing with boolean variables!
