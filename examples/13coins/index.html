    You are presented with 13 coins, all but one is defective, hence having a different weight from the others. However, you do not know whether the defective coin is heavier or lighter than normal. Given 3 chances to compare their weights on a balance, how do you find out the defective coin?
</p>

<p> 
    Write a program that allows your friend to play the game of 13 coins. Two sample programs are shown below (blue is user input):
</p>
<p></p>
<center>
    <img style="width:800px" src="./demo.png">  
</center>
<p></p>
<p> 
    Your program will have three main parts: 
    <ol>
        <li>
            Initialize the weights of all coins such that a randomly chosen one has a weight different from the others. Its weight can be either heavier or lighter with 50% chance each;
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask users to weigh the coins for 3 times;
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow users to input an answer and tell them whether they are right or wrong.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p> 
    You can assume that all user input is valid. For example, the user will not enter 3.1415926 when you expect an integer from 1 to 13.
<p>
    You are encouraged to use constants to denote the number of coins (13 in this case) and the number of weighing rounds (3 in this case). For the mathematically inclined among you, the minimum number of weighing for <i>n</i> coins is &#8968;log<sub>3</sub>(2<i>n</i>+1)&#8969;.
