</head>
<body>
Write a program that continuously prompts the user for a yes or no question, and then randomly selects from a set of
canned answers: The classic 8-ball responses were:
<br>
1.  As I see it, yes. <br>
2.  Ask again later. <br>
3.  Better not tell you now. <br>
4.  Cannot predict now. <br>
5.  Concentrate and ask again. <br>
6.  Don’t count on it. <br>
7.  It is certain. <br>
8.  It is decidedly so. <br>
9.  Most likely. <br>
10. My reply is no. <br>
11. My sources say no. <br>
12. Outlook not so good. <br>
13. Outlook good. <br>
14. Reply hazy, try again. <br>
15. Signs point to yes. <br>
16. Very doubtful. <br>
17. Without a doubt. <br>
18. Yes. <br>
19. Yes – definitely. <br>
20. You may rely on it. <br>
<br>
You do not have to have so many responses. Instead choose at least 5, or make up your own
